`Anagram`:  A word or phrase made by transposing the letters of another word or phrase

>The word "secure" is an anagram of "rescue."

Problem

The Function GetAnagrams returns a list of words. Create a Program which will print the words the are anagram of each other in a comma seperate List. 

For example 

``` javscript

console.log("Car, Arc");
```
