`Anagram`:  A word or phrase made by transposing the letters of another word or phrase

>The word "secure" is an anagram of "rescue."

## Problem

The Function GetWords returns a list of words. Create a Program which will print the words that are anagram of each other in a comma seperate List. 

## For example 

Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
